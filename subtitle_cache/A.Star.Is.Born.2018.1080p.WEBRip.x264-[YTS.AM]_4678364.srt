1
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,992
Bingo!

2
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,916
(chimps screeching)

3
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,517
Fucking hell.

4
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,158
(screech)

5
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,557
Fucking hell.

6
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
- Oh, God...
- Keep your shit together.

7
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,238
lf you wanna get 'em out of here.

8
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
- l can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it!

9
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,629
Security, we have a break-in. Get the...

10
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,479
l know who you are.
l know what you think...

11
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,235
lf you don't wanna get hurt,
keep your mouth shut and don't move.

12
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,348
The chimps are infected. They're highly
contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.

13
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,750
- lnfected with what?
- To cure, you must first understand.

14
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,673
lnfected with what?

15
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,357
Rage.

16
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,037
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.

17
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,394
No! No! No!

18
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,198
Listen, you sick bastard,
we're taking your torture victims with us.

19
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,793
We'll get you out of here.

20
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,351
The animals are contagious. The infection
is in their blood and saliva. One bite...

21
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,829
Stop... Stop! You've no idea!

22
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,117
(screaming)

23
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,839
Get it off! Help me!

24
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,036
Get it off! Get it off!

25
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,592
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her!

26
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,750
(screams) Oh, my God!

27
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,992
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now!

28
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,913
Oh, God...

29
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,429
(screaming)

30
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,711
(sharp intake of breath)

31
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,873
Hello?

32
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,554
(coughs)

33
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,193
Hello?

34
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,511
(louder) Hello!

35
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,315
(belches)

36
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,554
Hello?

37
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,233
Hello!

38
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,471
(alarm)

39
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,591
Hello?

40
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,271
Hello?

41
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,429
(noises from behind door)

42
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,595
(gasping and retching)

43
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,031
Father?

44
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,191
Father, are you OK?

45
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,800
Oh, shouldn't have done that.

46
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,350
Shouldn't have done that.

47
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,557
Shit!

48
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,276
(man) Over here!

49
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,270
- Over here!
- Come on!

50
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,595
Go, go, go!

51
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,675
Keep going!

52
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,513
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up!

53
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,788
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?

54
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,194
Let's go! Let's go!

55
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,430
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just move!

56
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,791
Come on!

57
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,751
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.

58
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,751
The giraffe falls over.

59
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,834
The man goes to leave and the barman says
''Oi! You can't leave that lying there.''

60
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,799
He says ''No, it's not a lion. lt's a giraffe''.

61
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,873
He's completely humourless.

62
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,758
You two should get on like a house on fire.

63
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,191
So who are you?

64
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,191
You're from the hospital.

65
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,636
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.

66
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,950
l'm a bicycle courier.

67
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,195
l was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.

68
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,875
Then l wake up today in hospital.
l wake up and l'm...

69
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,791
l'm hallucinating or l'm...

70
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,755
What's your name?

71
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,831
Jim.

72
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,040
l'm Mark. This is Selena.

73
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,872
OK, Jim.

74
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,314
l've got some bad news.

75
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,396
lt started as rioting, and right from
the beginning you knew this was different.

76
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,473
Because it was happening
in small villages, market towns.

77
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,959
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.

78
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,556
lt was in the street outside.
lt was coming through your windows.

79
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,392
lt was a virus.

80
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,198
An infection.

81
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,999
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.

82
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,435
lt was the blood.

83
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,909
There was something in the blood.

84
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,075
By the time they tried to evacuate
the cities, it was already too late.

85
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,958
The infection was everywhere.

86
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,429
The army blockades were overrun.

87
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,514
And that's when the exodus started.

88
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,479
The day before broadcasting stopped,

89
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,075
there were reports of lnfection
in Paris and New York.

90
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,158
We didn't hear anything more after that.

91
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,833
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.

92
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,275
Of course there's a government!

93
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,273
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...

94
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,478
No, there's no government,
no police, no army.

95
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,838
No TV, no radio, no electricity.

96
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,433
You're the first uninfected person
we've seen in six days.

97
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,231
Where's your family?

98
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,076
They're dead. Like Selena's.

99
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,196
Yours will be dead too.

100
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,914
Look, l have to find them.
They live in Deptford. l can walk it. OK?

101
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,468
You'll go and come back, yeah?

102
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,510
- You won't.
- Yes!

103
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,478
No one ever comes back.

104
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,791
So lesson one.

105
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,872
You never go anywhere alone
unless you've got no choice.

106
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,190
Lesson two.

107
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,193
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.

108
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,116
We'll take you tomorrow.

109
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,636
We'll all go and find
your dead parents together, OK?

110
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,039
Eat.

111
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,757
lf you want her to slow down,
you'll have to say.

112
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,152
- lf there's anyone...
- l understand.

113
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,231
- Anyone...
- l understand!

114
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,759
OK.

115
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,671
(sniffs)

116
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,114
Jim...

117
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,194
Wait!

118
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,188
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.

119
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,589
l'm not grateful.

120
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,711
My...

121
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,712
parents and my sister,
we went to Paddington Station,

122
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,360
hoping maybe we could get on a plane,
maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.

123
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,235
l remember my dad had all this cash,

124
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,517
even though cash was completely useless.

125
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,992
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.

126
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,516
Crowd was surging.

127
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,550
l lost my grip on my sister's hand.

128
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,870
l remember the ground was soft.

129
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,958
l looked down
and l was standing on all these people.

130
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,828
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...

131
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,708
Somewhere in the crowd
there were lnfected. lt spread fast.

132
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,997
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.

133
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,518
Climb over more people.
So l did that. l climbed.

134
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,875
And l got up on top of this kiosk.

135
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,835
Looking down, you couldn't tell
which faces were infected and which weren't.

136
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,629
Then l saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.

137
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,597
My dad.

138
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,791
His face...

139
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,074
Selena's right.
You should be grateful.

140
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,109
We don't have time to get back to the shop
before dark. We should stay here tonight.

141
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,399
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.

142
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,677
No, we'll all sleep in the same room. lt's safer.

143
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,395
(radio)

144
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,671
Jim.

145
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,991
- You're back.
- Yeah.

146
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,111
- How was it?
- Fine.

147
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,355
Give me a drink of that, will ya?

148
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,431
- lt's empty.
- Ha!

149
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,870
Here.

150
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,871
l'll start working on them, then.

151
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,151
Mark! Mark!

152
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,956
Selena! Help!

153
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,711
(Selena) lt's clear.

154
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,793
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?

155
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,996
And his daughter. From four doors down.

156
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,038
- Were you bitten?
- No.

157
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,918
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?

158
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,711
No.

159
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,392
Mark?

160
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,358
Wait...

161
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,555
(Mark screams)

162
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,436
Get that cleaned off.

163
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,231
Do you have any clothes here?

164
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,117
Um... l... Yes.

165
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,715
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.

166
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,315
More lnfected will be coming.
They always do.

167
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,798
(Jim) How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?

168
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,634
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. lt was on you.

169
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,874
l didn't know he was infected.
He knew. l could see it in his face.

170
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,192
lf someone gets infected,
you've about 20 seconds to kill them.

171
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,195
lt might be your brother, your sister
or your oldest friend. lt makes no difference.

172
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,479
Just so you know where you stand,
if it happens to you, l'll do it in a heartbeat.

173
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,599
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans, Jim?

174
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,958
Do you want us to find a cure and
save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?

175
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,429
Plans are pointless.

176
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,988
Staying alive's as good as it gets.

177
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,113
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

178
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,191
What's that?

179
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,031
Let's go.

180
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,312
What is it about tower blocks
and shopping trolleys?

181
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,358
Stop talking. lt's a long way up.

182
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,910
(Selena) Do you need a break?

183
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,991
- You?
- No.

184
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,551
Now l do need a break.

185
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,352
What's up?

186
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,351
Nothin'.

187
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,914
l got a headache.

188
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,433
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.

189
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,594
- Why didn't you say something before?
- l didn't think you'd give a shit.

190
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,833
You've got no fat on you
and all you've had to eat is sugar.

191
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,956
So you're crashing.

192
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,190
There isn't a lot we can do about that

193
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,149
except pump you full of painkillers
and give you more sugar. As for sugar,

194
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,435
Pepsi or Lilt?

195
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,551
Do you have any Tango?

196
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,552
Actually,
l did have a can of Tango somewhere.

197
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,629
(screech)

198
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,870
Quiet! That's an lnfected.

199
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,552
Oh no, they're in. Move!

200
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,954
Wait up, Selena!

201
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,751
Wait for me, please!

202
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,876
Please, Selena! Please!

203
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,190
- Wait for me!
- Come on!

204
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,191
- Run!
- Wait!

205
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,394
Please! For fuck's sake!

206
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,110
- Selena!
- (screams)

207
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,991
Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move!

208
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,071
Thank you. Thank you.

209
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,996
Open the door!

210
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,873
Open the door!

211
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,789
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?

212
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,279
What?

213
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,638
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?

214
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,915
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.

215
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,715
Go in. Go in!

216
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,192
( ''Frosty the Snowman'")

217
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,355
So, l'm Frank, anyway.

218
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,158
Jim.

219
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,918
- Selena.
- Selena. Good to meet you.

220
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,195
This is my daughter Hannah.

221
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,430
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.

222
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,791
Come on.

223
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,397
So...

224
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,311
This is great. Just great.

225
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,755
Calls for a celebration, l'd say.

226
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,752
Why don't you all sit down and...

227
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,673
Hannah, what have we got to offer?

228
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,149
We've got Mum's creme de menthe.

229
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,834
Great. Creme de menthe.

230
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,514
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.

231
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,955
Get comfortable.

232
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,558
- (Frank) Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.

233
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,393
Nah, the good ones. lt's a celebration.

234
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,869
Top cupboard.

235
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,554
So this is your place?

236
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,432
lt's nice.

237
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,149
There.

238
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,198
l know it isn't much but, well, cheers.

239
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,952
Cheers.

240
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,111
(groans)

241
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,591
You OK in there, Jim?

242
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,750
Yeah.

243
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:43,198
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.

244
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,950
You'll have to use the bucket.

245
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,754
Have to empty it each morning.

246
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,355
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.

247
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,078
lt's fine.

248
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,152
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.

249
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,035
We have a spare room.

250
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,268
ln there.

251
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,237
Are you and Selena...?

252
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,192
No. No, no, no.

253
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,872
Um...

254
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,235
l'll take the living room. lt's fine.

255
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,117
Right.

256
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,951
No, l mean, yeah.

257
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,871
So, um...

258
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,758
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.

259
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,279
Very spruce.

260
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,279
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.

261
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,989
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.

262
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,799
Probably need us more than we need them.

263
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,350
l think they're good people.

264
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,913
- Good people?
- Yeah.

265
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,111
You should be more concerned about
whether they're gonna slow you down.

266
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,795
- Because if they slowed you down...
- l'd leave them behind.

267
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,711
- ln a heartbeat.
- Yeah.

268
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,992
l wouldn't.

269
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,470
Then you're gonna wind up
getting yourself killed.

270
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,869
l'm gonna get some sleep.

271
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,077
Selena...

272
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,997
You think l don't get it, but l do get it.

273
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,634
And l know l'd be dead already
if l hadn't met you.

274
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,633
Sure.

275
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,233
No, look...

276
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,511
l mean, thank you.

277
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,630
And l mean, sure.

278
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,393
Goodnight, Jim.

279
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,471
Goodnight.

280
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,511
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.

281
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,559
l thought we'd be OK with the water
from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.

282
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,712
But it vanishes so quick
you wouldn't believe.

283
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,518
You drink it,

284
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,318
it evaporates,

285
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,391
turns stagnant.

286
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,671
They're all empty.

287
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,431
Hasn't rained in ten days.

288
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,593
You can set up a plastic sheet
to catch dew and condensation.

289
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,275
Saw it on TV once, but l can't make it work.

290
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,551
You'd never think it.

291
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,273
Needing rain so badly.

292
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,189
Not in fucking England!

293
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,672
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.

294
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,835
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.

295
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,311
(man on radio) Salvation is here.
The answer to lnfection is here.

296
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,278
if you can hear this, you're not alone.

297
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,672
There are others like you.
There are other survivors.

298
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,876
We are soldiers and we are armed.

299
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,111
Oh, my God. Soldiers.

300
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,591
- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,

301
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,956
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

302
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,794
- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now itjust repeats.

303
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,155
- lt's a recording?
- Yeah, it's a recording.

304
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,038
But this is where it's telling us to go.

305
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,190
Just there.

306
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,236
The way things are, we might need
two or three days to get up there.

307
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,958
''We''?

308
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,716
Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah
do need you more than you need us.

309
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,837
- Look, l didn't...
- No, it's OK. lt's the truth.

310
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,309
l can't leave the block if it's the two of us.

311
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,188
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. l couldn't risk it.

312
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,918
But with other people...

313
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,118
lf it's a recording,
the soldiers who made it could be dead.

314
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,556
- lt's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to lnfection...

315
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,758
There is no answer!
lt's already done all the damage it can!

316
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,559
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.

317
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,553
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!

318
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,755
Or die here.

319
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:00,312
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.

320
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,557
We need each other.

321
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,714
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.

322
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,391
So we have to try and get there.

323
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,993
Get there how?

324
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,555
Just so you know,
l don't take cheques or credit cards.

325
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,838
- (Frank) What do you think?
- lt's the most direct route.

326
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,948
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.

327
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,270
(Frank) Let's just get it done.

328
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,750
(Jim) No, no.

329
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,229
No. See, this is a really shit idea.

330
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,311
You know why?
Because it's obviously a shit idea.

331
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,598
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel
full of fucking smashed cars...

332
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,478
lt's really fucking obviously a shit idea!

333
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,710
Hold on!

334
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,317
Dad!

335
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,316
(screaming and laughing)

336
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,439
Fuck!

337
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,989
The world's worst place to get a flat.

338
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,277
Agreed. l think we'd better do this quick.

339
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,750
l've got the wheel. You're on the jack.

340
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,150
Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?

341
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,231
Hear what?

342
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,075
(Hannah) Right, l've done it.

343
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,999
Dad?

344
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,116
(scrabbling sounds)

345
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,678
- Jesus Christ!
- (Hannah screaming)

346
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,239
Fucking rats!

347
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,828
They're running from the lnfected.

348
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,751
Move it!

349
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,958
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.

350
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,157
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!

351
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,837
Lift, lift!

352
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,275
- (Selena) Don't look at them! Don't look!
- (Jim) l can see them! They're coming!

353
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,791
(screeching)

354
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,228
Come on, Hannah!

355
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,629
Almost.

356
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,518
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- l'm trying.

357
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,680
Three, two, one,

358
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,398
drop it!

359
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,715
- Get in the car!
- Come on!

360
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,995
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!

361
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,791
(Jim) Whoo!

362
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,391
Goodbye, you fuckers!

363
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,235
Frank, stop the cab.

364
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,475
Let's shop.

365
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,110
(Frank making engine noises)

366
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,113
You...

367
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,313
You...

368
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,155
You...

369
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,708
(Jim) Anybody seen any buns?

370
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,473
Hmm. lrradiated.

371
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,516
Don't take anything
that needs to be cooked, OK?

372
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,352
l think you can eat that raw.

373
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,237
Decaffeinated coffee...

374
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,311
Put that back.

375
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,630
Can'tjust take any crap.

376
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,032
lf l never see another chocolate bar again,
it'll be too soon.

377
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,000
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!

378
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,030
Now, single malt,
16-year-old, dark, full flavour.

379
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,837
Warm but not aggressive.

380
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,276
- (Hannah and Selena laughing)
- Peaty aftertaste.

381
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,917
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.

382
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,518
Either we do this now or we're walking.

383
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,231
Not you.

384
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,635
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?

385
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,711
You heard.

386
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,191
Where are you going?

387
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,549
We've got enough food, Jim.

388
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,870
We don't have any cheeseburgers.

389
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,160
(quietly) Like going on holidays
with your aunt!

390
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,115
Oh, Jesus.

391
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,359
Hello?

392
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,318
l hate you!

393
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,111
Find anything?

394
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,953
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.

395
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,031
OK, we're done here.

396
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,957
OK, Hannah.

397
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,632
Easy. Brake!

398
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,711
Brake, brake!

399
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,231
Out.

400
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,072
(Selena) Mmmm! Oh my God!

401
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,678
l can, like, taste the vitamin C.

402
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,153
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.

403
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,311
What did you say?

404
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,073
The raisins. They're so moist.

405
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,631
Look over here.

406
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,232
Like a family.

407
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,675
(Hannah) Do you think they're infected?

408
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,071
(Frank) No.

409
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,994
They're doing just fine.

410
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,511
Come on. Let's eat!

411
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,874
Know what l was thinking?

412
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,509
That you'll never hear
another piece of original music again.

413
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,593
You'll never read a book
that hasn't already been written,

414
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,275
or see a film that hasn't already been shot.

415
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,717
Um.... that's what you were thinking.

416
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,597
No.

417
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,995
l was thinking l was wrong.

418
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,191
About what?

419
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,831
All the death.

420
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,391
All this shit.

421
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,272
lt doesn't really mean anything
to Frank and Hannah because...

422
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,910
Well, she's got her dad
and he's got his daughter. So...

423
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,036
Cheeky monkey!

424
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,950
l was wrong when l said
staying alive is as good as it gets.

425
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,829
See, that's what l was thinking.

426
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,912
Was it?

427
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,195
Mm. You stole my thought.

428
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,997
Sorry.

429
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,717
That's OK.

430
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,791
You can keep it.

431
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,714
lt's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.

432
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,594
l can't sleep.

433
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,194
Me neither.

434
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,555
Doesn't feel safe, does it?

435
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,631
Outside like this.

436
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,789
l think we're safe enough.

437
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,440
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.

438
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,509
Yeah, l noticed that.

439
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,033
Hey, Selena...

440
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,111
What? What is it?

441
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,356
How'd you get to sleep?

442
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,269
Bloody hell. Must've needed
a hell of a prescription for that lot.

443
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,478
l didn't need a prescription.
l qualified as a chemist.

444
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,994
Oh, great. Valium.

445
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,548
Not only will we be able to get to sleep

446
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,189
but if we're attacked in the middle
of the night, we won't even care.

447
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,430
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.

448
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,476
Can l, Dad?

449
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,471
l don't think so, sweetheart.

450
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,993
Please?

451
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,431
- No.
- l can't sleep.

452
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,994
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.

453
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,874
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.

454
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,997
Night-night.

455
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,274
You're a big softie, Frank.

456
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,517
Frank?

457
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,591
Hannah?

458
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,477
Frank?

459
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,871
Hello? Hello!

460
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,074
Hello!

461
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,549
Hello! Hello!

462
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,311
(mumbles)

463
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,311
Shh...

464
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,313
You're having a bad dream, that's all.

465
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,951
Thanks, Dad.

466
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,596
(car horn)

467
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,268
Come on, sleepyhead.

468
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,791
Come on, Babe Ruth.

469
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,677
(Frank) Hurry up.

470
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,716
- Did l miss breakfast?
- (Selena) You'll sleep through anything.

471
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,590
- (Jim) Did you have a fry-up?
- (Frank) We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door!

472
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,472
(radio) Our location
is the 42nd blockade, the M602,

473
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,518
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

474
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,431
You must find us. Please!

475
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,556
Salvation is here.

476
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,552
The answer to lnfection is here.

477
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,271
Must be Manchester.

478
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,631
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.

479
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,630
No fire crews to put it out.

480
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,668
42nd blockade.

481
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,990
This is it.

482
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,074
l don't understand, Dad.
Did they leave?

483
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,152
- l don't like this. l think we should go.
- No!

484
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:09,350
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.

485
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,591
Nothing.

486
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,511
l can't believe it.

487
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,477
Frank...

488
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,717
Frank!

489
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,432
- We have to go.
- Yeah.

490
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,909
Go fucking where?!

491
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,516
(cawing)

492
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,510
Get out of it.

493
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,871
Get out of it!

494
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,428
Dad, are you all right?

495
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,080
Yeah, l'm fine, sweetheart.

496
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,554
Sorry l lost my temper.

497
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,676
Hannah...

498
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,593
l love you very much.

499
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,591
- What?
- Keep away from me.

500
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,910
Stay where you are.

501
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,798
- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!

502
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,269
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!

503
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,352
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!

504
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,439
(Hannah) What's wrong? Dad!

505
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,869
Jim! Jim, he's infected!

506
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,474
- No!
- Now, Jim! Now!

507
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,836
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!

508
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,148
Kill him!

509
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,475
Stay away from him!

510
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,989
Keep away from the body!

511
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,437
Dad?

512
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,480
(man) Three survivors. One male, two female.

513
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,757
l repeat, one male, two female.

514
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,308
ETA, 15.

515
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,755
Put the kettle on.

516
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,149
l'm Major Henry West.

517
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,998
- Welcome.
- Jim.

518
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,991
Hello, Jim.

519
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,752
Hello.

520
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:19,596
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets
and a boiler that produces hot water.

521
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,989
So you can all have a shower.

522
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,277
You look like you need one. Please.

523
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:49,394
lt ain't funny. l got loads of cooking to do,
you fucking Doris!

524
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,476
Run him over!

525
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,753
(Jim) How is she doing?

526
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,877
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.

527
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,829
lt's all fucked.

528
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,831
What do you mean?

529
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,116
Oh, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.

530
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,191
Hey, don't do that.

531
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:24,590
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough,
strong, and she'll cope just like l'll cope.

532
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,434
- Just like you'll cope.
- l don't want her to have to fucking cope.

533
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,989
l want her to be OK.

534
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,590
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.

535
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,353
lt was OK for them and it was OK for us.

536
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,869
Now it's all just fucked.

537
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,759
So you heard our broadcast?

538
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:20,196
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.

539
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:26,150
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army
base with helicopters and a field hospital.

540
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,473
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to lnfection.

541
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,711
Yeah.

542
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:41,112
As l said before, it's here. Though
it may not be quite what you imagined.

543
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,278
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.

544
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,352
The fire drove hundreds of lnfected
out of Manchester.

545
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,398
The surrounding area's teeming with them.

546
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,594
But don't worry.

547
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,069
You're quite safe here.

548
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:05,672
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights
which we've rigged up to a generator.

549
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,148
High perimeter wall which helps.

550
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:13,313
And we've been lacing the ground
with tripwires and land mines.

551
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,871
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn,
but if they get in, we hear them.

552
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,710
Secondary to protection,
our real job is to rebuild. Start again.

553
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,109
The belly of the house. The heart.

554
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:33,228
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot
water. The first step towards civilisation.

555
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,311
The kitchen.

556
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,436
Here you are. l'll swap you.

557
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,592
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.

558
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:44,559
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.

559
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,915
Jones, our resident tin opener.

560
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,878
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.

561
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,471
l can't wait.

562
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,830
And lastly, meet Mailer.

563
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,357
Mailer, Jim.

564
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,476
Jim, Mailer.

565
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,194
Got infected two days ago.

566
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:18,149
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold
and we got a chain round his neck.

567
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,591
Keeping him alive?

568
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,399
The idea was to learn something
about lnfection.

569
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,671
Have him teach me.

570
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,071
And has he?

571
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,230
ln a way.

572
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:54,436
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.

573
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,590
Farm crops,

574
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,240
raise livestock.

575
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,629
He's telling me he's futureless.

576
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,754
And eventually he'll tell me how long
the lnfected take to starve to death.

577
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,592
(singing)

578
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,235
You'll have to wait and see

579
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,470
Hope it's chips, it's chips

580
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,028
We hope it's chips, it's chips

581
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,391
(cheering)

582
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,549
Hat.

583
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,029
So, what have we here?

584
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,991
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...

585
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,199
- (man) Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!

586
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,635
- lt's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.

587
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,792
Absolutely. l was going to propose a toast

588
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,872
but this omelette will do just as well.

589
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,749
- To new friends.
- (all) New friends.

590
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,554
Jones, did you notice while cooking
that these eggs were off?

591
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,916
l thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.

592
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,797
Get rid of it.

593
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,515
(man) Doris, you twat.

594
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,273
l don't suppose you can cook, can you?

595
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:08,313
l can't tell you how badly we need
someone with a little flair in the kitchen.

596
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:12,757
What a fucking disappointment.
l saw those eggs, l thought it was Christmas.

597
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,957
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.

598
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,759
You muppet! Look at him, eh?

599
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,719
He's still waiting
for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.

600
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,952
- You don't know nothing.
- l think Bill's got a point.

601
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,032
lf you look at the whole life of the planet,

602
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,951
we...

603
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,999
you know, Man has only been around
for a few blinks of an eye.

604
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,075
So if the infection wipes us all out,

605
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,235
that is a return to normality.

606
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,958
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.

607
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,157
Have you met our New Age sergeant?

608
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,834
Our spiritual guru.

609
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:59,914
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why
did you join the army in the first place?

610
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,559
This is what l've seen
in the four weeks since lnfection.

611
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,154
People killing people.

612
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:13,597
Which is what l saw in the four weeks before
lnfection, the four weeks before that...

613
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:18,913
As far back as l care to remember,
people killing people.

614
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,470
Which to my mind
puts us in a state of normality now.

615
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,273
- You're not eating?
- l don't want to eat.

616
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,033
You must eat, Hannah.

617
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,237
l don't want to eat.
l want to bury my dad.

618
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:43,112
He's one of the people you're talking about.

619
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,949
(explosion)

620
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,996
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

621
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,910
Move!

622
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,195
Move! Move! Move!

623
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,110
(siren)

624
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,711
Enemy in front!

625
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,589
Mick, l fucking got one!

626
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:42,150
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt!

627
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,475
Fucking hell! He bounced!

628
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,073
Cease fire!

629
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,355
l ain't never seen that in my life!

630
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,000
- Report clear!
- Fucking hell!

631
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,718
- Clear.
- Clear.

632
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,869
Yeah, yeah, clear.

633
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,031
Oh, hello!

634
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,111
(woif whistle)

635
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,473
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't
gonna be needing this any more.

636
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,676
Cos you got me to protect you now.

637
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:36,474
You wanna get your hands on a really
big chopper, you just come and see me.

638
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,959
Fuck you!

639
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,110
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.

640
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,111
How about right now?

641
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,557
Mitchell!

642
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:50,392
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go
picking a fight with me, son.

643
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,154
Sergeant Farrell!

644
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,712
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.

645
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,110
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.

646
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,231
Slow down.

647
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,073
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

648
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,754
Clear the bodies off the lawn.

649
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,988
The rest of you, go with him.

650
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,871
My apologies.

651
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,152
Drink?

652
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,400
Look, we're grateful, OK?

653
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:47,519
We're very grateful for your protection
but if we're gonna stay here...

654
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,079
- Who have you killed?
- No one.

655
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:54,109
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive
now if you hadn't killed somebody.

656
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,072
l killed... l killed a boy.

657
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,231
A child?

658
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,551
Yes.

659
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:19,836
But you had to.
Otherwise he'd have killed you.

660
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,037
Survival.

661
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,311
l understand.

662
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,989
l promised them women.

663
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,871
What?

664
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,589
Eight days ago l found Jones
with his gun in his mouth.

665
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:49,236
He said he was going to kill himself
because there was no future.

666
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,073
What could l say to him?

667
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:57,154
We fight off the lnfected or we wait
until they starve to death and then what?

668
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,715
What do nine men do
except wait to die themselves?

669
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:07,670
l moved us from the blockade, l set the radio
broadcasting and l promised them women.

670
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,115
Because women mean a future.

671
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,791
Selena! Hannah!

672
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,238
- What is it?
- We have to go.

673
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,311
- Jim, wait!
- No time! Come on!

674
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,116
Come on!

675
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,077
We get in the car and we go!

676
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,757
No! You're not going to keep them here!
You've got to let them go!

677
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,957
You can't keep them here!
Stay where you are!

678
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,634
l'm not gonna let you keep them here!

679
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,551
You can't do this!

680
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,235
Right, get him!

681
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,230
l want to give you a chance.

682
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,356
You can be with us.

683
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,115
But l can't let them go.

684
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,988
OK, Jim? OK.

685
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,471
Him too.

686
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,679
(Farrell) Smithers says
''Women and semen don't mix.''

687
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,558
And Mr Burns says
''We all know what you think, Smithers.''

688
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,438
And that was my favourite joke
in The Simpsons.

689
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,990
That's what they're doing a few
hundred miles away, across the Channel,

690
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:52,312
across the Atlantic. Eating dinner
and watching the fucking Simpsons!

691
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,551
They're sleeping in their beds
next to their wives.

692
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:01,112
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator
because the OC has gone insane!

693
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:05,999
Starting the world again when the rest
of the world hasn't even stopped.

694
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,312
Just imagine, just think about it.

695
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,515
How could lnfection cross the oceans?

696
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,718
How could it cross the mountains
and the rivers? lt can be stopped.

697
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,394
Right now TVs are playing
and planes are flying

698
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:24,314
and the rest of the world
is continuing as fucking normal.

699
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,597
Think! Actually think about it.

700
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,876
What would you do
with a diseased little island?

701
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,871
They quarantined us.

702
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:44,478
''There is no lnfection.
lt's just people killing people.'' He's insane!

703
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,275
Time to go.

704
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,591
Quarantine?

705
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,112
- Please...
- Believe me, l'm not interested.

706
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:38,075
You see, l'm gonna have the black one.
And l'm gonna make her squirm.

707
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,914
Mitchell, l swear to God
it's gonna end badly for you.

708
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,638
Move.

709
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,517
Come on, move! Get up!

710
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,591
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!

711
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,159
Get up!

712
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,390
Move your fucking arse!

713
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,836
(Farrell) Come on then,
you fucking pansies. Do me first.

714
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,309
(Jones) No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat.

715
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,312
- (Farrell) So you're gonna stick me?
- (Jones) Shoot 'em!

716
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,960
- (Mitchell) Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker!

717
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,952
(Farrell) ls that how you'd let
your sergeant go out, Jones?

718
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,871
- l'll shoot them!
- No, you won't.

719
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,270
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?

720
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,557
l'm gonna enjoy this.

721
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,988
You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
You wanna shoot me?

722
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:48,073
- You wanna shoot me? l'll kill you!
- Where's he fucking gone?

723
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,999
Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!

724
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,472
- Jones, move it!
- l can see him! l can see him!

725
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,551
Where are you?

726
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,671
- Can you see him?
- Through there!

727
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,751
(gunfire)

728
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,469
Oh no. We're fucked.

729
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,033
We're fucked!

730
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,439
Relax.

731
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,830
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.

732
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,559
And no shooter.

733
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,914
He's dead.

734
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,991
(thunder)

735
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:08,068
(West) The first thing we're going to do
is make you look more presentable.

736
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:11,596
The lady of the house
has an extensive wardrobe

737
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,114
which she certainly has no use for.

738
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,832
You can't do it to Hannah.

739
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,469
Go to the master bedroom,
pick out a wide selection.

740
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,551
Yes, sir.

741
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,791
(Hannah) No...

742
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,791
(man) Ladies...

743
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,113
- lt's only dressing up!
- No! Selena!

744
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,397
- l thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.

745
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,038
(Hannah) Selena!

746
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,111
Whoa, whoa, relax!

747
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,673
Selena!

748
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,435
Selena! Selena!

749
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,359
You need to leave me alone
with Hannah. OK?

750
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:06,709
- Listen, right. The OC wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.

751
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,793
lf you want us to get changed,
you have to leave the room. OK?

752
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,595
lt's just polite.

753
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,754
Yeah, all right.

754
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,512
All right.

755
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,353
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.

756
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:02,268
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, OK?
Come on. Eat these.

757
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,430
Are you trying to kill me?

758
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,676
No, sweetheart.

759
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,194
l'm making you not care. OK?

760
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,590
What you doing?!

761
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,876
(siren)

762
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,349
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim!

763
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,589
Move!

764
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,240
Stay here and put the dresses on.

765
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,799
Let's go! Go!

766
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,308
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.

767
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,960
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.

768
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,231
Davis?

769
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,431
(engine fails)

770
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,272
Fuck it!

771
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,798
(gunfire)

772
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,917
- What was that?
- Lightning.

773
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,791
l heard something.

774
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,315
lt sounded like a Claymore to me.

775
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:19,108
All right, l'll go and hit the floods,
take a butcher's.

776
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,677
Girls,

777
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,274
keep an eye on him, will ya?

778
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,829
Those pills,

779
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:39,309
l think they're having an effect.

780
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,789
l can feel them. And...

781
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,155
l don't feel sleepy.

782
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,231
But...

783
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,389
They've been a long time.

784
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,993
What are you gonna do
if they don't come back?

785
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,678
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?

786
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,671
ls that the way it works?

787
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,751
Shut up.

788
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,993
l don't think they are coming back.
l think they've been killed.

789
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,548
- l said shut up!
- Hannah...

790
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,071
They're dead.

791
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,469
And you're gonna be next.

792
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,595
- Get up!
- Whoa!

793
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:31,152
We're gonna get out of here.
Stay with it, Hannah.

794
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,959
Don't worry. l feel fine. Really.

795
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,191
Get him off me!

796
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,555
Get him off me!

797
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,191
lt's Jones! lt's Jones!

798
01:31:55,120 --> 01:32:00,433
Oi! Where the fuck are you going?
What's all the fucking shouting about?

799
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,511
(screaming)

800
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,311
Don'tjust stand there,
you soppy cunt! Get after them!

801
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,311
You two, in there! Move!

802
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,595
(wheezing)

803
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,757
Come on, then!

804
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,673
What the fuck you gonna do now?

805
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,471
(screaming)

806
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,556
Come on up!

807
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,078
Col!

808
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:04,755

809
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,876

816
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:31,553
(screech)

817
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,951
Hannah?

818
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:45,473
Selena?

819
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:00,358
l haven't got any bullets.
l haven't got any fucking bullets!

820
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,200
Don't fucking leave me!

01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,152
Come on!

822

Move!

823
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,594
Move! Move!

But don't worry, l'll get you out of here.

825
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,118
Then we'll find a nice little fucking place
somewhere. Just you and me.

826
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,430
And we'll live happy ever after, eh?

827
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,071
(screaming)

828
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,549
That was longer than a heartbeat.

829
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,271
Jim?

830
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,630
Listen. Listen. lt's not all fucked.

01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:41,549
We're gonna be OK. lt's not all fucked.

832
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,837
- l've got to explain something.
- Shut up.

833
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,755
lt's gonna be OK.

834
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,436
Hannah, it's OK! He's not infected.

835
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,511
But l thought he was biting you.

836
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,160
l was kissing her. Are you stoned?

837
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:03,310
- lt's a long story.

838
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,436

Come on! Move!

840
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,910
You killed all my boys.

Wait...

842
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:29,113

They're locked.

847
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:13,789
The gates are locked!

848
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,311
Fucking do it!

849
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:42,029
Come on, Jim, breathe! Fucking breathe!
